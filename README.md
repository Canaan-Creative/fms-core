# fms-core

The core functions that Canaan FMS and other miner management systems needed to communicate with and control Avalon miners.

These code can be used as reference about how to communicate with Avalon miners. This package can be used directly in your Python projects.

After install it with:

`pip install fmc-core`

A script command 'fmsc' will be available. Get help by:

`fmsc -h`

A good start point to view code is the \_\_main\_\_.py

Any feedback are welcome.
